# OpenParty (Unconference Community website)


This repository stores the OpenParty website.


## Installation

To get setup with OpenParty code you must have the follow installed:

> * Python 2.5+
> * MySQL
> * virtualenv 1.4.7+

## Setting up environment


Create a virtual environment where dependencies will live:

```
$ virtualenv --no-site-packages openparty
$ source openparty/bin/activate
(openparty)$
```

Install openparty project dependencies::

```
(openparty)$ pip install -r requirements
```


## Setting up the database

This will vary for production and development. By default the project is set
up to run on a SQLite database. If you are setting up a production database
see the Configuration section below for where to place settings and get the
database running. Now you can run:

```
(openparty)$ python openparty_project/manage.py syncdb
(openparty)$ python openparty_project/manage.py migrate core
```

## Running a web server

In development you should run:

```
(openparty)$ python manage.py runserver
```

## Deploy it

If you are deploying on ubuntu, you may install those build dependencies.

```
sudo aptitude install libmysqlclient-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev
```

Install those python libs through virtual env.

```
sudo easy_install -U pip
sudo pip install virtualenv
sudo mkdir /usr/local/virtualenv
cd /usr/local/virtualenv
sudo virtualenv --distribute --no-site-packages openparty
source /usr/local/virtualenv/openparty/bin/activate
cd PROJECT_FOLDER

```

```
sudo su -
source /usr/local/virtualenv/openparty/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements
```
